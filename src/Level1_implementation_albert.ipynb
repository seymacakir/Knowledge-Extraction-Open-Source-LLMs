They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"\n","

In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \\\"Killing Time\\\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \\\"No, No, No\\\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \\\"No, No, No\\\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \\\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\\", the group's first number-one single, \\\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\\" and \\\"Say My Name\\\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \\\"Say My Name\\\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyonc\\u00e9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \\\"After All Is Said and Done\\\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"What mental health issue did Beyonce go through?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56be8d423aeaaa14008c90b2\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"depression\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 169\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"What event occured after she was publicly criticized?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56be8d423aeaaa14008c90b3\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"boyfriend left her\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 320\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who supported Beyonce through her depression?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56be8d423aeaaa14008c90b6\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 714\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"What event caused Beyonce's depression?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bf7e603aeaaa14008c9681\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"split with Luckett and Rober\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 194\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"How long was Beyonce depressed?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bf7e603aeaaa14008c9682\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"a couple of years\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 396\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who helped Beyonce fight her depression the most?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bf7e603aeaaa14008c9685\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 714\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who replaced Luckett and Roberson in Destiny's Child?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d462f82ccc5a1400d8311f\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 110\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who was blamed for Luckett and Roberson leaving Destiny's Child?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d462f82ccc5a1400d83120\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Beyonc\\u00e9\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 149\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who helped Beyonc\\u00e9 overcome her depression during the years following the Destiny's Child split?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d462f82ccc5a1400d83121\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 714\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Which newest member was removed from Destiny's Child?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d462f82ccc5a1400d83123\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Farrah Franklin\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 110\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        }\n","      ],\n","      \"context\": \"LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.

Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, \\\"Bootylicious\\\" and the title track, \\\"Survivor\\\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\\"Crazy in Love\\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\" and the top-five songs \\\"If I Were a Boy\\\" and \\\"Halo\\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\\"Halo\\\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\\"Sweet Dreams\\\", and singles \\\"Diva\\\", \\\"Ego\\\", \\\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\\" and \\\"Video Phone\\\". The music video for \\\"Single Ladies\\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\\"first major dance craze\\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \\\"You Belong with Me\\\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyonc\\u00e9 received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \\\"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\\\". The single \\\"Drunk in Love\\\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \\\"Pretty Hurts\\\", as well as best collaboration for \\\"Drunk in Love\\\". In November, Forbes reported that Beyonc\\u00e9 was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row\\u2014earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013.

the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion. They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \\\"Most Powerful Women in the World\\\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \\\"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\\\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z placed at number one on the \\\"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\\\", for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \\\"highest-earning power couple\\\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\\u00e9 earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyonc\\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry. That year, Beyonc\\u00e9 was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings. MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyonc\\u00e9 would become the highest-paid black musician in history; she succeeded to do so in April 2014.

Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyonc\\u00e9's voice \\\"versatile\\\", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonc\\u00e9's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore

The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"House of Dereon became known through Beyonce and which of Beyonce's relatives?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bed32f3aeaaa14008c94cf\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 12\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Beyonce's grandma's name was?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bed32f3aeaaa14008c94d0\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Agn\\u00e8z Der\\u00e9on\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 218\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Beyonce's family's company name is what?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bed32f3aeaaa14008c94d1\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Beyond Productions\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 408\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"What types of garments are sold by Beyonce's clothing line?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bed32f3aeaaa14008c94d2\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 670\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Which two countries can you purchase Beyonce's clothing line?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bed32f3aeaaa14008c94d3\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"US and Canada\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 834\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who partnered with Beyonce to start the clothing line, Dereon?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe2a2a10cfb1400551369\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 12\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"When did Beyonce and her mother start Dereon?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe2a2a10cfb140055136a\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"2005\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 91\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who was the business named for in Beyonce's family?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe2a2a10cfb140055136b\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"grandmother, Agn\\u00e8z Der\\u00e9on\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 205\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Where were items from the clothing line displayed?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe2a2a10cfb140055136c\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"in Destiny's Child's shows and tours\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 572\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"Who shares in the House of Der\\u00e9on fashion line introduction with Beyonc\\u00e9?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f6922ccc5a1400d83394\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"her mother\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 12\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"question\": \"What is the name of the House of Der\\u00e9on junior collection?\",\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f6922ccc5a1400d83397\",\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"text\": \"Der\\u00e9on.\",\n","              \"answer_start\": 526\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"is_impossible\": false\n","        }\n","      ],\n","      \"context\": \"Beyonc\\u00e9 and her mother introduced House of Der\\u00e9on, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.

Beyonc\\u00e9 along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \\\"Demand A Plan\\\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyonc\\u00e9 became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \\\"I Was Here\\\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\\u00e9 would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \\\"Chime for Change\\\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyonc\\u00e9 said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \\\"finding the best qualities in every human being.\\\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyonc\\u00e9 is also taking part in \\\"Miss a Meal\\\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.\"\n","    }\n","  ]\n","}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Overall, this function takes raw data with articles, questions, and answers,\n","# and transforms it into a structured dictionary separating titles, contexts,\n","# questions, answer texts, and answer starting positions.\n","\n","# Function to transform the data into the required format\n","def transform_data(data):\n","    transformed_data = {\n","        'id': [],\n","        'title': [],\n","        'context': [],\n","        'question': [],\n","        'answers': []\n","    }\n","    for article in data['data']:\n","        title = article['title']\n","        for paragraph in article['paragraphs']:\n","            context = paragraph['context']\n","            for qa in paragraph['qas']:\n","                transformed_data['id'].append(qa['id'])\n","                transformed_data['title'].append(title)\n","                transformed_data['context'].append(context)\n","                transformed_data['question'].append(qa['question'])\n","                transformed_data['answers'].append({\n","                    'text': [answer['text'] for answer in qa['answers']],\n","                    'answer_start': [answer['answer_start'] for answer in qa['answers']]\n","                })\n","    return transformed_data\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bcRWZSeZH-ke","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720670394471,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":268,"user":{"displayName":"Tuğçe Çağlayan","userId":"08211472969283930637"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Transform the data\n","train_transformed = transform_data(train_data)\n","dev_transformed = transform_data(dev_data)\n","\n","# Create Dataset objects\n","train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict(train_transformed)\n","dev_dataset = Dataset.from_dict(dev_transformed)\n","\n","# Create a DatasetDict with the Dataset objects to prepare it processing\n","raw_datasets = DatasetDict({\n","    'train': train_dataset,\n","    'validation': dev_dataset\n","})\n","\n","print(raw_datasets)\n","\n","def remove_empty_answers(dataset):\n","    def is_valid_example(example):\n","        return len(example['answers']['text']) > 0\n","\n","    return dataset.filter(is_valid_example)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Z8leLz3JICNF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720670400468,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2678,"user":{"displayName":"Tuğçe Çağlayan","userId":"08211472969283930637"}},"outputId":"7a182f7a-e97e-4239-850d-863ae4f11a88"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["DatasetDict({\n","    train: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'],\n","        num_rows: 130319\n","    })\n","    validation: Dataset({\n","        features: ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'],\n","        num_rows: 11873\n","    })\n","})\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# filtering out examples (question-answer pairs) where there are no answers.\n","# This ensures your training data focuses on questions with actual answers.\n","\n","train_dataset_cleaned = remove_empty_answers(raw_datasets[\"train\"])\n","\n","# bring the train and validation sets together in a single dictionary\n","\n","raw_datasets_processed = DatasetDict({\n","    'train': train_dataset_cleaned,\n","    'validation': raw_datasets[\"validation\"]\n","})\n","\n","raw_datasets[\"validation\"]\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":118,"referenced_widgets":["72cde736e1344426afc2a6bc15fcad24","d2ab4eff8a1049b1899519cfa7f4da1a","e74ae243a801478a9939924cdbcc1357","8f800983f38f470d9fef0dc758a002ee","fda911e3f2f346219665b00692e919a7","153861ab2e454ad4acb20216450c7afa","851fbb2972a84851947e05417fe4999d","e1d583aee3e145fbb1cfde9e2d48220d","140864fe84f148b1929b9db57f5cdca5","6514fb006bab45f7b7dff25192b2078e","93d4946861a94878af91c25261f902df"]},"id":"KZh8fCHaIGyx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720670409354,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2778,"user":{"displayName":"Tuğçe Çağlayan","userId":"08211472969283930637"}},"outputId":"a71954a0-a78f-4399-a3b6-4a65bbe54fff"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Filter:   0%|          | 0/130319 [00:00<?, ?
